# Cellular automata simulatior 


### Descrition
A [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) simulator that runs in a CLI, implemented in Haskell.



### Features
- Customisable ruleset, the deafult ruleset is set to [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- Iterating over genreations step by step
- Livemode that let's you iterate over n genration
- up to 99 x 99 sized field.


### How to run
1. Make sure you have Haskell installed on your device, including GHCI.
2. Clone reposetory using git
3. Open GHCI using your prefered CLI.
4. Load Oblig.hs using ```:load <filename>```
5. Run the main action by typing: ```main``` and pressing enter



### TODO:
- Refactor code for readbility
- Implement abiltiy to load custom rules from a file
